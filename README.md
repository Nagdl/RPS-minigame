## AI Support Explanation

This project was developed with the assistance of generative AI tools. AI helped in:

- Generating the initial code structure and logic (e.g., score handling, emoji-based buttons, and result display)
- Optimizing UI layout and interactive design suggestions
- Debugging and improving user experience for responsiveness and clarity

The use of AI served as a development companion, streamlining both coding and design processes.
